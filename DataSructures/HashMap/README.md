# Hash Map

## Description

Hash map provides you Θ(1)

### Time Complexity
#### Average Case 
|Access	|Search	|Insertion	|Deletion	|
|	--- |	--- |	---	| --- | 
|	N/A |	Θ(1) |	Θ(1)	| Θ(1) |

#### Worst Case

|Access	|Search	|Insertion	|Deletion|
| 	--- |	--- | 	--- |	--- |
|	N/A | 	O(n) |	O(n) | 	O(n) |

#### Space Complexity
**O(n)**
